JS Homework 1, FunctionsTasks

1. Define a function, that takes string as argument and prints "Heelo, %arg%!"
2.Define a function sum() and a function multiply() that sums and multiplies (respectively) all the numbers in a list of numbers. For example, sum([1, 2, 3, 4]) should return 10, and multiply([1, 2, 3, 4]) should return 24.
3.Define a function reverse() that computes the reversal of a string. For example, reverse("I am testing") should return the string "gnitset ma I".
4. Define a function is_palindrome() that recognizes palindromes (i.e. words that look the same written backwards). For example, is_palindrome("radar") should return True.
5. Define a procedure histogram() that takes a list of integers and prints a histogram to the screen. For example, histogram([4, 9, 7]) should print the following:
****
*********
******
(usage time.sleep(s) possible for better visualization)
6.Define a function caesar_cipher that takes string and key(number), whuch returns encrypted string
7.define a function diaginal_reverse() that takes matrix and returns diagonal-reversed one:
1 2 3         1 4 7
4 5 6 returns 2 5 8
7 8 9         3 6 9
8. Write a function game() number-guessing game, that takes 2 int parameters defining the range. Using Math.random() generate random int from the range. While user input isn't equal that number, print "Try again!". If user guess the number, congratulate him and exit.
9.Define a function, which takes a string with N opening brackets ("[") and N closing brackets ("]"), in some arbitrary order.
Determine whether the generated string is balanced; that is, whether it consists entirely of pairs of opening/closing brackets (in that order), none of which mis-nest.
Examples:
   []        OK   ][        NOT OK
   [][]      OK   ][][      NOT OK
   [[][]]    OK   []][[]    NOT OK
10. Write a function char_freq() that takes a string and builds a frequency listing of the characters contained in it. Represent the frequency listing as a Python dictionary. Try it with something like char_freq("abbabcbdbabdbdbabababcbcbab").
11. Write a function dec_to_bin() that taces decimal integer and outputs its binary representation.
12. Write a ship battle game, which is similar to ex.8, except it takes 1 integer as an order of matrix, randomly generates index (x, y) and checks user input (2 integers).
(tip: use var1, var2 = raw_input("Enter two numbers here: ").split())
*Visualize the game.
